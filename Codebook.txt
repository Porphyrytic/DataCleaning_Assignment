Study Design (as described by the authors listed above): 
-------------
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. 
From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details.

The Processed Data consists of Gyrometer (Gyro) and accelerometer (Acceleration) readings.
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
	-'XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
- All gyro and acceleration measurements have been normalised to [-1.0:1.0]
- A subset of the total dataset has been taken: of the original 561 measurements only the 66 mean and standard deviation measurements were used for analysis
	- These variable were identified by mean() and std() labels in the original dataset. 
	- Other Variables with "mean" values computed on windows or post-transformation (e.g. gravityMean) were ignored
- Data from the Training and Test datasets were merged to create one Dataset with 30 test subjects.
- Variable names have been extended to be more human-readable i.e. Time-Domain instead of 't'. Acceleration instead of 'acc' 

- Aggregated the data further to produce average (mean) measurements for each individual test subject in each activity.
