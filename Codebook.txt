Data was downloaded: 13th March, 2016

Data consists of Gyrometer (Gyro) and accelerometer (Acceleration) readings:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
	-'XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. readings taken from Human Activity Recognition project:
- All gyro and acceleration measurements have been normalised to [-1.0:1.0]
- A subset of the total dataset has been taken: of the original 561 measurements only the 66 mean and standard deviation measurements were used for analysis
	- These variable were identified by mean() and std() labels in the original dataset. 
	- Other Variables with "mean" values computed on windows or post-transformation (e.g. gravityMean) were ignored
- Data from the Training and Test datasets were merged to create one Dataset with 30 test subjects.
- Variable names have been extended to be more human-readable i.e. Time-Domain instead of 't'. Acceleration instead of 'acc'
